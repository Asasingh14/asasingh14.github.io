I'm a software engineer with strong interests in both cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity. I'm currently working toward the PJPT certification from TCM Security as well as the AWS Solutions Architect certification. With a strong curiosity for how systems can be broken (and secured), I find myself constantly toggling between writing clean code and tearing apart vulnerable applications.

Iâ€™m currently diving deep into red teaming methodology, CTF challenges, and practical exploitationâ€”especially focused on areas like privilege escalation and web app vulnerabilities. At the same time, I continue to expand my skills in defensive practices, scripting automation, and cloud infrastructure, building hands-on experience that spans both offensive and blue-team strategies.

Outside of technical work, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and sharing that knowledge through walkthroughs, writeups, and tool development. Whether it's building custom scripts, analyzing attack surfaces, or documenting lab environments, I treat every opportunity as a chance to refine my craft. This site serves as my personal archive of growth, challenges, and progress in tech.
